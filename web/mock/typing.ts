 * A Claude Code session the shim attached runs inside a pseudo-terminal the
 * device owns, so `session.set` for the settings the agent names, and
 * `session.command` for `/compact`, are keystrokes: they take a moment to
 * land, they need an idle terminal, and what the terminal will not take is
 * refused rather than queued. These are pure functions so the mock's behaviour
 * can be read and tested without a socket; `server.ts` holds the timers.
