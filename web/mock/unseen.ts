/**
 * A47 — the gateway's mark on a session that stopped working and waits for the
 * person (PROTOCOL §4.4), kept the way the gateway keeps it, so what
 * `npm run dev:mock` shows is what a gateway would.
 *
 * A session works while its state is `starting` or `running`, and waits for the
 * person while it is `needs_approval` or `needs_input`, or `idle` or `readonly`
 * with a control other than `none`: the status dot's green and amber. The mark
 * is set when a session moves from the one to the other, read from the states
 * alone, and cleared when it works again, when an app says the person has
 * looked (`session.seen`) and when it is archived. Pure, so the rule can be read
 * and tested without a socket; `server.ts` sends the frames.
