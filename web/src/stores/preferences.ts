/**
 * A35 — the account's preferences, which belong to the gateway rather than to
 * this browser: `hello` seeds them, `preferences.updated` keeps every app of the
 * account in step, and a change is written with `PATCH /api/preferences`.
 *
 * `undefined` is a gateway that predates them, which is not the same as "off":
 * the switch is disabled with a note rather than drawn as a choice the reader
 * could make (`docs/DESIGN.md` § "Paused by the usage limit").
 *
 * A41 put the Settings screen's own six values in the same object. They are
 * read from the settings store, which the whole app reads already, so every
 * object that arrives here is handed to it as well.
