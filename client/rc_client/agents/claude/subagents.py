"""Whether any subagent a Claude session started is still working.

The owner's ruling (2026-09-18, `docs/DESIGN.md` § "Working means all of it"): a
session is working while any work it started is still under way — its own turn,
or a subagent it spawned that has not finished — and the turn does not end until
the last of it has. Claude Code offers nothing to ask: a subagent's metadata
carries what it is and who called it, never how it is doing. What it does write
is every subagent's transcript, under the session's own directory, so the last
row of each file is the whole answer.

A subagent is working until its transcript ends with an assistant message that
ended a turn (`end_turn`, `stop_sequence`, `max_tokens`) or with the API error
that stopped it. That is deliberately not the rule the parent's own transcript
uses, where a missing `stop_reason` ends the turn as well (A34): the parent is
read row by row as it grows, while these files are read from the end long after
the fact, and on the owner's machine 58 of 151 subagent transcripts stop on an
assistant row whose message never completed. Reading those as finished is the
defect this file exists to fix. Nothing marks a subagent that was killed, so a
transcript nothing has written to for thirty minutes counts as abandoned, which
is what stops one from holding a session green for good.
