"""The slash commands a Grok session offers, and the list the device remembers.

Grok Build pushes its whole command list over ACP as an `available_commands_update`
the moment a session opens — built-in shell commands, skills, plugin commands and
workflows — and runs any of them locally when a prompt's text begins with the name,
answering in `agent_message_chunk` at no cost in model tokens. Everything here maps
that list onto the protocol's `Command` (A27): the exclusions below, one line of
description, the hint an app shows as the argument placeholder, and the group it
sections a long list by.

The last list is kept in the device home so a session with no live process can still
answer `session.commands`, after a restart of the daemon too.
