"""Which Codex threads on this machine are the device's to publish (A18).

Codex keeps one history for the whole machine, so the desktop app's chats and
scheduled automations, an IDE extension's threads and the subagents a thread
spawned all sit in the daemon's index beside what somebody typed at a terminal.
Every thread records the client that created it — `originator` on the index
entry and in the rollout's own `session_meta` — and where that client sits:
`source` is `"cli"` for a TUI, `"exec"` for `codex exec`, `"vscode"` for an
app-server client, and an object for a subagent.
