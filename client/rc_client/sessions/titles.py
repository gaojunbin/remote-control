"""Which title a session shows, and who is allowed to change it.

Three sources, in order of precedence:

1. a title the user set through `session.create` or `session.set`, which is
   sticky and is never overwritten by anything an agent produces;
2. the agent's own summary of the conversation — Claude Code writes an
   `ai-title` row into its transcript, Codex names a thread — which replaces a
   first-prompt title whenever it arrives or changes;
3. the first line of the first message, until something better shows up.

Whether the user pinned a title is the device's own business, so it lives in
the registry's key/value table rather than on the wire object.
