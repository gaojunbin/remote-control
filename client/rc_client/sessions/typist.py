"""Amendment A40: the device typing into an attached Claude Code terminal.

A Claude channel carries user text and nothing else, so a phone could never
change the model of a session running in a terminal, nor compact it. What it
can do instead is what the person would do: type `/model`, walk the picker with
the arrow keys and press `s`, which applies the choice to this session and
writes no settings file of theirs. The keystrokes go through the pseudo-terminal
the shim started the CLI inside (`rc_client.channel.pty`).

Three rules make that safe to do to somebody else's terminal.

- **Only into an idle terminal.** No turn, no dialog, an empty draft and a
  keyboard that has been still for two seconds; anything else is `conflict` and
  nothing is queued. A person mid-sentence must never have characters appear.
- **Never the argument form.** `/model opus` and `/effort low` apply at once
  but save the choice as the person's default. The pickers, confirmed with `s`,
  are the only route this file knows.
- **The transcript decides.** A script is done when the CLI has written the
  command and its answer, not when the keystrokes went out; until then the
  phone is told nothing and the session's `meta` says the old value.
