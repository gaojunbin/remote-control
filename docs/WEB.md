# The web app

A static single-page app the gateway serves from `web/dist`. React 19, Vite, TypeScript, and
hand-written CSS with no framework. It talks only to the gateway and follows
`protocol/PROTOCOL.md` exactly.

## Screens

| Route | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Decides where an open lands and goes there; the `*` fallback does the same |
| `/login` | Username and password sign-in against the gateway, and **Create an account** when the gateway takes registrations (A24) |
| `/devices` | Device list: a computer glyph, the name, a status line of online state, platform, session count and reach, the client build, and the agents as logos; Rename, Update and Revoke on every row; **Add device** with the copyable one-liner, the pairing code, its expiry, live handshake steps, and the scan flow beside them. The row itself opens the device |
| `/devices/:deviceId` | One device: the machine's own facts, including the hostname and the architecture the row drops, then a card per agent it found, how each is signed in, and a meter per rate-limit window (A33) |
| `/pair` | Claims the token a host printed as a QR code and shows the same handshake (A23) |
| `/sessions` | Every session across every device: one collapsible group per device, its active rows and then its own collapsed **Archive**, a search, an agent filter and a device filter, and **New session** in a right-hand drawer |
| `/sessions/:deviceId/:sessionId` | The chat: sidebar, timeline, composer, status line |
| `/settings` | Grouped settings — the account with its role, **Change password** for a member or **Users** for an admin, sign out, browser notifications, the **Sessions** group with "Resume after the limit resets" (A35), voice language and push-to-talk, and an About group with the gateway origin, both versions and the connection state |
| `/users` | The admin's accounts screen: the registration switch, one row per account, Reset password / Disable / Delete, and **Add user** (A24). A member who types it lands on Sessions |

## Commands

```sh
cd web && npm ci
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite on 5173, proxying `/api` and `/ws` to `http://127.0.0.1:8787` |
| `npm run dev:mock` | The same server plus the bundled mock gateway. Sign in as `admin` / `dev`, or as the member `alice` / `devdevdev` |
| `npm run mock` | Only the mock gateway, on 8787 |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck, then build to `web/dist` |
| `npm test` | Vitest |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint, flat config |

`RC_GATEWAY=http://host:port npm run dev` points the proxy somewhere else.

## The mock gateway

`mock/server.ts` implements the app-facing half of the protocol — the HTTP API, `WS /ws/app` and
`WS /ws/stt` — so the whole UI can be developed with no gateway and no device. It ships two devices
and twenty sessions covering running, needs-approval, needs-input, errored, idle, paused by the
usage limit,
terminal-controlled, shared through the Claude channel, shared through the Codex daemon, Codex,
terminal sessions on a device that has neither the shim nor the Codex daemon, three sessions whose
CLI exited (`control: "none"`) and two archived by hand, spread over both devices so every device
group has both halves of an Archive under it. Between them they show all five status-dot tones.
One of the two devices advertises all four agents (A25, A26) — the two newest copied from
`protocol/fixtures/objects/agent.grok.json` and `agent.pi.json`, which `tests/agents.test.tsx`
asserts they still equal — and carries one session of each: a Grok Build session a terminal holds
inside Grok's leader, which the device has joined (`control: "shared"`, A28), a second Grok Build
session an app started, so its command list can actually be opened, and a pi session on the
`on-request` permission mode its extension enforces. The other device carries a Grok Build agent
whose leader mode is off (`attach_ready: false`) and a terminal Grok session under it, which is
where the leader hint renders. `ses-limit` is the A35 scenario: a Claude Code turn that ran into
the five-hour window, so its history ends with the vendor's sentence as an `error`, a
`turn_completed` carrying `limit`, and the `resume {scheduled}` the device wrote, and its summary
carries the pending `Session.resume` the notice above the transcript reads. Change and Cancel there
reach `session.resume_set` and `session.resume_cancel`, which the mock answers with the session and
a fresh `resume` row; a message sent into that session cancels the resume the way §6.3 says a device
does. `GET` and `PATCH /api/preferences` are served per account, `hello` carries `preferences`, and
a `PATCH` fans `preferences.updated` out to every app socket of the account, so two browser tabs
signed in as the same person follow each other.
Opening the running session plays a scripted turn: streamed thinking, streamed Markdown, tool rows
with a live output box, a failing shell run, two diffs, an approval and a question. Both drive the
turn to completion. The shared session plays the A10 path end to end: a send while the terminal is
idle is injected at once and answers with a relayed Allow/Deny approval, a send during that turn is
held as a queue entry and becomes a bubble only when the turn ends and the CLI takes it (A19), and
`session.set`, `session.stop` and `session.takeover` answer with the errors the contract specifies.
Its history also carries a question the terminal answered first, so the card reads "Answered in the
terminal" (A20). The shared
Codex session plays the A11 path: it opens on a turn the terminal started, a send steers that turn
(`accepted: "steered"`), `session.set` applies, Stop interrupts, and a command approval offers all
four daemon decisions. Its history carries a request the TUI answered first, so the card reads
"Answered in the terminal". A send is answered at once and the `user_message` echoed 400 ms later under the
request id, the way a device behaves (A12), so the pending bubble is visible in development; a
message queued during a turn is dequeued when that turn ends and keeps its id, while a turn the mock
starts itself, such as a `first_message`, mints its own block id and exercises the app's fallback.
It knows two accounts (A24), `admin` / `dev` and the member `alice` / `devdevdev`, with the
registration switch closed and the account routes of 3.9 behind the admin's role, so the sign-in
form, registration, the Users screen and a member's Settings can all be driven with no gateway. The
scripted devices are the admin's: a member's `hello`, device list and session list come back empty,
a subscribe naming one of the admin's sessions answers `not_found`, and a pushed frame reaches only
the account that owns the device it is about. Pairing walks
`waiting → enrolled → online → agents` over about six seconds, and the speech socket returns
scripted partials and a final transcript. One of the two devices runs the build `/api/config`
reports and the other the one before it, so the list shows a row with nothing to do beside a row
offering Update; `device.update` is accepted, flips that device to `updating`, and brings it back on
the new build six seconds later, which is what its `hello` would report (A22). Both halves of
pairing by scanning are there (A23): `POST /api/pairing/requests` mints a claim token for a host,
`POST /api/pairing/requests/{token}/claim` mints its pairing code and starts the same progress, and
the host's status poll answers at once instead of holding a connection for 25 s the way the gateway
does — nothing in the app polls it. Every agent carries the accounts of A33, and the two devices
between them hold each shape a device page can meet: a Claude Code Max account with a tier and three
windows, a Codex `pro` account whose five-hour window is 84 % spent, so one meter is drawn in the
attention colour, an xAI account the leader exposes no windows for, pi's two providers — an
Anthropic subscription and an *OpenAI API key · api.relay.example* — and on the other device a
Claude Code signed in nowhere, a Codex account whose windows failed to read, and a Grok Build the
machine's older client never looked at. `withoutLimits` in `mock/fixtures.ts` is what divides them:
the device list and `hello` carry the accounts alone, and only the reply to `device.agents` carries
`limits`, `limits_error` and `limits_checked_at`, 900 ms later, so the page's *Checking…* state is
really seen. The mock and the tests share
`mock/fixtures.ts`, so a fixture change shows up in both.

Two gateway behaviours the mock used to be missing are in `mock/replay.ts`, so that a development
run can reveal the bugs they guard against. `session.send` is idempotent under its request id
(§8 rule 7, A12): the mock remembers what it answered per session and answers a repeat with the
same result without playing the message a second time, which is the whole reason Retry is safe.
And `session.subscribe` has a replay bound — 200 events here, where the gateway keeps 2 000 or
4 MiB, deliberately small so any session with history can reach it — answering `resync: true` with
no events for a cursor the buffer no longer covers, which is what drives the app's resync branch:
blank the timeline, keep the unconfirmed sends, reload from history.

## Structure

```

Every user-visible string lives in `src/strings.ts`, the English table and the type; the Chinese
table beside it is `src/strings.zh-Hans.ts`.

## Language

The app speaks English or 中文 (`Settings → Language`), and it starts in English whatever
`navigator.language` says — a developer whose system is Chinese still reads the agent in English,
and a surprise translation at first launch reads as a different product. The choice is
`language` in the settings store, persisted with the other preferences under the signed-in
account's key (`rc.settings.<username>`, A24), and `<html lang>` follows it.

`strings` is not a table but a view on one: a proxy that reads `stringTables[language]` on every
property access, so a component keeps writing `strings.composer.send` and needs to know nothing.
Two things follow from that. A change re-renders every open screen because `App` carries the
language as the key of its `<Routes>` — the socket and the session probe sit above it and are not
disturbed. And **no module may read a string at import time**: a table built at module scope
(`const TABS = [{ label: strings.nav.devices }]`) keeps the language the app booted in.
`src/layout/AppLayout.tsx` and `src/lib/errors.ts` build theirs inside a function for exactly that
reason.

`src/strings.zh-Hans.ts` is typed `StringTable`, so the compiler refuses it the moment a key is
added or renamed in English, and `tests/language.test.tsx` walks both tables to catch a missing
nested key that the type cannot see. The functions in the table (`archiveGroup(n)`,
`status.workingQueued(agent)`, `format.minutesAgo(n)`) are translated as functions, which is how
"3m ago" becomes "3 分钟前" while the number stays where it is.

Only the app's own words are translated. Everything the device reported — agent output, device
names, paths, branches, and the model, effort, permission and speed **labels** the agent's own
lists carry — is drawn as it arrived, so the composer's chip reads "Sonnet 4.5 High" in both
languages. "Remote Control", "Claude Code" and "Codex" stay in Latin script, and each of the two
interface languages is always named in its own script.

## The icon

`public/icon.svg` is the source: a near-black rounded square with three white dots at the corners of
a downward-pointing triangle, joined by grey bars that stop short of the dots. It matches the iOS
`AppIcon` and `src/layout/Mark.tsx`, the same drawing inlined for the topbar, the login card and the
chat sidebar. `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` and `icon-maskable-512.png` are rendered from it in a
headless Chrome; the maskable one is full bleed with the artwork inside the central 80 %. Change the
SVG and re-render all three together.

## Voice

Tapping the mic opens `WS /ws/stt`, captures the microphone through an AudioWorklet with a
ScriptProcessor fallback, downsamples to 16 kHz mono PCM16LE, and sends roughly 120 ms binary
frames. Partial transcripts stream into the composer's own field. The control row then holds a
waveform, an elapsed timer and exactly one thing in Send's slot, at Send's size: the button
**Done**, disabled until the socket is listening. Done sends `stt.stop` and leaves the transcript
in the field — nothing is ever sent by the act of stopping the recording — and the click is
answered in that same slot at once. The capsule gives way to Send's pill holding a spinner
(`WorkingPill`, the class `.working-pill`), which is not a button and not a disabled one either, so
nothing in the row takes a click while `stt.final` is on its way; the status line reads "Finishing
the transcript" until it lands, and the elapsed clock stops at the click, its interval running only
while the state is `listening`. There is no Cancel — a dictation you do not want is Done and then
edited or cleared like any draft — and no time limit; a long dictation is cut into segments whose
transcripts are joined in order. Reaching for the field takes it back and stops listening, keeping
the words recognised so far: a keystroke does it, and so does a pointer down on the field itself,
which is how a person stops the dictation to read what was said. The field's own programmatic
focus — taking a command row, say — is not a pointer and ends nothing. The mic is hidden entirely
when the gateway reports `stt.enabled: false`.

**While dictation runs, the field follows the words** (`docs/DESIGN.md` § "The composer"). The
field grows with its content to 220 px and scrolls inside after that, and a dictated write brings
no caret with it, so a long transcript used to sit on its first screen until Done. Each transcript
write — every partial, and the final one that lands as the run ends — now sets `followTail` in
`Composer.tsx`, and the effect that measures the field reads the flag once and puts the last line
in view by setting `scrollTop`, never animating it. Typing sets nothing, because a caret keeps
itself visible, and neither does a polished answer or an Undo: those are the person's draft again.

## Dictation polish (A29)

A finished dictation can go through the model the gateway operator configured before the person
reads it, on the person's own switch. The gateway says whether it can (`hello.polish.enabled`,
kept in the connection store, `{enabled: false}` by default and on an older gateway), and the
Settings page's Voice group offers three things only when it can: the switch "Polish dictation
with AI", a model select filled from `GET /api/polish/models` when the group renders with the
switch on (the first model is chosen when none was; a failed fetch keeps the select and shows one
line), and a Moderate / Strong control. The footer says what leaves the browser and when: what was
dictated and the last few messages of the conversation, sent to the gateway's model only while the
switch is on. A gateway without the feature shows the switch disabled with "This gateway has no
polish model configured". The three values live in the settings store per account
(`polishEnabled`, `polishModel`, `polishStrength`).

In the composer the words the recogniser produced land the instant dictation ends, exactly as
before; the status line then reads "Polishing…" while `POST /api/polish` is out with the dictated
span alone — the `dictation` bookkeeping already knows where it starts — the model, the strength,
the dictation language and the open session's last twenty `user_message` / `assistant_text` blocks,
oldest first, each trimmed to 4000 characters (`src/features/voice/polish.ts`, pure). The answer
replaces only that span, never a character the person typed, and "Polished · Undo" sits under the
field until the next edit or send; Undo puts the dictated words back. A failure leaves the words
and shows "Polishing failed, your words are unchanged" for a few seconds. While the request is out
the spinner Done became stays in Send's slot: Send is not drawn, Enter does nothing — it is Send,
so it waits with it — and the `⋯` menu beside Send, whose only item is a send, is not drawn either.
The slot becomes Send the moment the field holds what will be sent: the polished words when the
answer lands, the dictated ones when the request fails, and the person's own the instant they type
over the wait, which drops the request. Which of the three the slot holds is one pure function of
the dictation state and the polish phase (`src/features/voice/primarySlot.ts`), read by the
listening row and the ordinary row alike. Nothing is ever sent by itself: polished text is a draft
like any other.

**The mock** reports `polish.enabled: true`, serves two models, and polishes with a 600 ms delay by
dropping "um"/"uh", merging doubled words, capitalising and closing the sentence, so the whole flow
can be watched; its speech-to-text final transcript carries fillers on purpose. Tests cover the pure
helpers, the slot over every pair of phases, the composer flow (success, failure, the slot and the
Enter key while the request is out, a typed edit that drops it, undo, both disabled cases), the
settings group in both gateway states, the per-account keys and the three protocol fixtures. The
flow was driven in Chrome against the mock at 1280 px and 400 px: the Voice group with the three
controls, the spinner in Send's slot with "Polishing…" in the status line, and "Polished · Undo"
under the field once Send is back.
## Messages from other agents (A30, A34)

A `user_message` whose `source` is `agent` — a teammate's report or a task notification the Claude
CLI filed as a user turn, reduced by the device to who said what — is not the person's side of the
conversation, so it is not drawn in their bubble at all. `Timeline`'s dispatch sends it to
`blocks/AgentMessageRow.tsx` instead of `UserMessageRow`: a muted block on the quiet surface, at the
full width of the content and on the left where the agent's own prose is, captioned "from another
agent" above the text (`chat.fromAgent`; the terminal caption is `chat.fromTerminal`, "terminal",
and both are translated). `UserMessageRow` keeps only the person's own messages and has no variant
left for an agent to borrow. `Trigger` is one exported union for `source` and
`turn_started.trigger` — `remote | terminal | queue | agent` — and nothing in the stores switches on
it beyond the type, so an `agent`-triggered turn behaves as a terminal one. The mock's terminal
Claude session carries one such message, so the block and the bubble can be compared on one screen;
the optimistic-send reconciliation only ever matches `source: "remote"`, so an agent row is never
mistaken for the browser's own echo.

These are the agent's workings rather than something written to the person, so **Simple does not
draw them**, and the jump-to-latest count does not count them there. `drawnAt` in
`src/stores/timeline.ts` was keyed by `kind` alone; it now reads `source` as well, through
`isAgentMessage`, and both the rows and the count follow from that one function.

## Paused by the usage limit (A35)

A Claude Code or Codex turn the vendor's five-hour or weekly window ended closes with
`stop_reason: "error"` and `limit {window_minutes, resets_at}`, and the device schedules a resume for
a minute after the reset when the account has asked for one. Four surfaces carry it, and one small
pure module carries every word.

**The switch is the account's, not the browser's.** `src/stores/preferences.ts` holds
`Preferences | undefined`: `hello.preferences` seeds it, a `preferences.updated` frame replaces it,
and a change is written with `PATCH /api/preferences` and rolled back if the gateway refuses.
`undefined` means a gateway older than A35 — not "off" — and Settings then draws the switch disabled
under "Your gateway does not offer this yet." rather than as a choice that could be made. The store
joins `signOut()` like every other store that holds something of an account's. Everything else in
Settings is still local to the browser in `stores/settings.ts`; this one row is the exception, which
is why it lives in its own store rather than in that one.

**The notice sits above the transcript.** `ChatPage` draws `ResumeNotice` between the header and the
timeline whenever `session.resume` is set, and nothing else changes: the status dot still reads the
session's state, which is `idle`, because the pause is what the notice is for. It reads "Paused by
the usage limit · resumes 3:50 PM", with "about" when the device estimated the time and "second
try" / "third try" appended from `attempts`. **Change** opens a popover holding one
`datetime-local` field prefilled with `at` and bounded to between a minute and eight days away; the
form is `noValidate`, so the refusal is this app's sentence rather than the browser's own bubble,
which no two browsers word the same. **Cancel** sends `session.resume_cancel` at once, with no
confirmation. Both answer with the session, and nothing is guessed in between: a failure leaves the
notice where it was and says why.

**The timeline says what happened.** `TurnEndRow` draws a `limit` end as a notice — "Ended at the
usage limit · resets 3:50 PM", and without the time when `resets_at` is null — rather than as the
red "Turn failed" an ordinary `error` stop gets. `ResumeRow` draws the device's steps in the same
voice, and `fired` draws nothing at all: `isRenderable` in `stores/timeline.ts` drops it before it
becomes a block, because the moment of resuming is the prompt in the person's bubble. That prompt is
a `user_message` with `source: "resume"`, drawn by `UserMessageRow` under the caption "Sent for you
after the limit reset", and a `turn_started` with `trigger: "resume"` moves the session exactly as a
remote turn does. None of these are the agent's workings, so **Simple keeps all of them**.

`src/features/chat/resume.ts` is the one place the words and the bounds live: `timeText` (the
viewer's zone, the clock face of the interface language, the date added when it is not today),
`resumeNoticeText`, `limitEndText`, `resumeRowText`, `resumeBoundError` and the two
`datetime-local` conversions, which go through the local calendar rather than `toISOString` so the
field never shows a UTC minute. All of it is pure and takes the clock as an argument, so
`tests/resume.test.ts` reads a fixed afternoon rather than whatever time the suite runs at.

## Push and the service worker

`public/sw.js` is registered in production builds only. It is network-first for navigations,
cache-first for hashed assets under `/assets/`, and bypasses `/api`, `/ws`, `/install.sh` and
`/dist/`. Only successful same-origin responses are cached, so a gateway error page never becomes
the offline shell. A push payload carries only a device name and a reason; clicking the notification
focuses an open tab or opens `/sessions/<device_id>/<session_id>`.

The line the notification shows is `rc.title`, which the gateway writes in full; the worker's own
`TITLES` table is the fallback for a payload that carries none, and it knows the three A35 kinds —
`limit_reached`, `resumed` and `resume_dropped` — alongside the four older ones. A kind this build
has never seen still says a device needs attention and still deep-links to its session, so a tab
left open across a gateway upgrade keeps working. `tests/service-worker.test.ts` evaluates `sw.js`
against a stand-in `self` and drives both handlers, because the file is plain JavaScript the browser
loads on its own and nothing else in the suite would reach it.

## Accounts

Every person on a gateway has an account (A24), and what an account sees is its own: its devices,
their sessions, its pairing codes. The app never has to filter anything — the gateway answers only
what belongs to the caller — so the work here is the three screens the amendment adds and one rule
about what this browser remembers.

**Signing in** asks for a username and a password. The username is remembered in `localStorage`
under `rc.username` and prefilled next time, so the second sign-in is the password alone;
`localStorage` is already scoped to the gateway's origin, which is what makes one key enough.
A `403` reads "This account is disabled." and a `401` says only that one of the two was wrong.
`LoginPage` is the only screen that reads `GET /api/health`'s `auth.registration_open`, because it
is the only screen that offers **Create an account**: the link appears under the button when the
gateway takes registrations, swaps the card for username, password and **Create account**, and puts
"Sign in instead" beneath it. Registering is a sign-in. A refusal is worded from its status —
`409` taken, `400` the username and password rules, `403` registration closed, which also removes
the link.

**The Account group in Settings** shows the username with its role word under it, then the rows that
account has. The two are independent, because the gateway's own rules are: **Users** appears for the
admin role, and **Change password** (a modal asking the current password and the new one; `401`
reads "That is not your current password.") appears for every account except the built-in `admin`,
whose password is the gateway's `RC_PASSWORD` and which `POST /api/password` refuses by username. A
second account created with the admin role therefore gets both rows; it used to get neither the
password row nor any way to change its own password from the app. **Sign out** stays last.

**Signing out empties the tab.** `signOut` in `src/stores/signOut.ts` is the one place that knows
the list: it closes the socket, puts the connection store back to what no `hello` has confirmed
(`stt`, `polish`, the gateway version and the protocol number included, so the composer never
offers a capability this account has not been told about), and calls `reset()` on every store that
holds something of an account's — chat, drafts, outbox, answers, commands, sessions, devices,
users. `App` calls it both for the Sign out button and for a `4401`/`4403` close. Before this, all
of it stayed in memory until the page was reloaded, including the value typed into a question field
whose own placeholder says it is not stored; on a shared browser the next person had it. The
device and session lists go with the rest, so the landing rule waits for the new account's `hello`
instead of deciding from the previous account's list.

**`/users`** is `src/features/users/`, gated on the role in the auth store: a member who types the
address is sent to `/sessions` before anything is fetched. The registration switch sits at the top
and answers the tap before the `PATCH /api/registration` lands, going back if the gateway refuses
it. Each row carries the username, `role · state`, the device count and the last sign-in as a
relative time or "never"; the `admin` row is given no menu, because none of its three actions is
allowed. Delete names what goes with the account ("…and its 2 devices"). Every dialog surfaces its
own refusal, read from `error.code` by `userErrorText` in `src/lib/accountErrors.ts`; `conflict`
means a taken username on `POST /api/users` and a refusal to touch `admin` everywhere else, so each
caller supplies that one sentence. The list is `src/stores/users.ts`: nothing pushes accounts over
the socket, so it is whatever the last `GET /api/users` said, and every write re-reads it.

**The app's own preferences belong to the account, not to the browser.** The settings store
persists under `rc.settings.<username>`, and `readSettingsFor` in `src/stores/settings.ts` points
it at the signed-in account whenever that changes — `App` calls it from the auth store's username.
The persist `merge` lays the defaults under whatever was stored, so an account that has chosen
nothing reads the defaults rather than inheriting the last person's language, dictation language or
timeline detail. The login screen, where nobody is signed in, keeps its own key, `rc.settings`.
Nothing of this reaches the gateway.

## Behaviour worth knowing

- **A draft belongs to its session** (`docs/DESIGN.md` § "The composer"). The words and the files
  live in `src/stores/drafts.ts`, keyed by `<device>/<session>`, for the tab's life and no longer;
  the composer reads the entry its session names and writes back to it. The chat route keeps one
  `ChatPage` across a switch, so `ChatPage` also gives `<Composer>` the session key as its React
  `key`: that is what remounts it, which is what ends a dictation with the session it was spoken
  for — `useVoice` tears the microphone and its sockets down on unmount, and the words it had
  already recognised are in that session's draft. Nothing typed for one session can reach another,
  and a question waiting in the session being opened never sees the words meant for the one being
  left. A refused send hands the words and the files back to the session they were meant for.
- **The transcript is bounded.** `MAX_TIMELINE_ITEMS` in `src/stores/timeline.ts` caps a live
  timeline at 3 000 rows: past it the oldest go, `oldestSeq` moves forward with them and `dropped`
  counts them, which is how the chat store knows to set `historyHasMore` again — scrolling back
  pages them in as ordinary history. A page the reader asked for by scrolling is never capped, or
  paging back would fetch the same events for ever. `useChat.close` stamps a conversation with the
  order it was left in and keeps the three most recently closed; the rest are dropped with their
  slash-command lists, and a conversation that is open — `close` runs on every reconnect too — is
  never among them.
- **Every sentence a person reads comes from the string tables.** `lib/ws.ts` and `lib/gateway.ts`
  mint their failures with a code and an empty message, and `errorText` in `src/lib/errors.ts`
  turns the code into a sentence, falling through to the caller's own fallback when it knows none.
  The composer's two catch blocks go through it like every other surface; they used to render
  `err.message`, which for the app's own failures was English nobody could translate ("not
  connected", "no reply from the gateway", "connection lost").
- **A dictation ends when the composer stops accepting one.** `useVoice` watches `enabled` and
  cancels a run already in flight, so a device going offline or a terminal taking the session back
  closes the microphone instead of streaming audio to the gateway for the life of the tab. The
  words already recognised stay in the field. `SttSocket.start()` has a five-second connect
  timeout, and `cancel()` rejects a connect still waiting, so a gateway that accepts the TCP
  connection and then says nothing cannot leave the composer in `starting` with Done disabled.
- **The attachment cap is enforced where the list is written.** Two attach operations can be in
  flight at once — a pasted batch, then the file dialog before the paste has finished encoding —
  and each computes its budget from the count it started with, so the store's `addAttachments`
  applies `MAX_ATTACHMENTS` itself and reports what it had to drop. What the second batch has to
  say is added to what the first said rather than replacing it.

- **Where an open lands** is `src/layout/Landing.tsx`, the element behind `/` and behind the `*`
  fallback. It waits for the devices store's `loaded` — the socket's `hello` snapshot calls
  `replaceAll`, which sets it — drawing the same `boot` placeholder `App` draws while the session
  probe is out, and then navigates with `replace` to `/sessions` when the account has at least one
  device and to `/devices` when it has none. Deciding before the snapshot has synced would send
  every account to Devices for the length of a round trip. The rule runs once per open because the
  navigation unmounts it: somebody who then opens Devices on an empty account stays there, and a
  device arriving later moves nobody. `LoginPage` returns to `/` when there is nothing to go back
  to, so signing in lands by the same rule; a remembered `from` still wins, fragment and all (A23).
- **The session list** is one selector, `selectSessionLayout` in `src/stores/sessions.ts`. It
  filters on the device, the agent and the search text, then returns one `DeviceGroup` per device
  that still has something to show: the device, whether the user folded it shut, its active rows,
  its own Archive and whether that Archive is open. Both the Sessions page and the chat sidebar
  render its result, so the two lists cannot drift; `tests/sessionLayout.test.ts` owns the rule.
  `docs/DESIGN.md` states it in full.
- **A session with no title still has a name.** `sessionTitle` in `src/strings.ts` turns an empty
  or blank `title` into "Untitled session", and the session row, the chat header, the chat sidebar
  and the search text `selectSessionLayout` matches on all read it, so an unnamed thread never
  draws a blank line above its meta and is still found by those words.
- **Collapse state** is two arrays of device ids in the settings store, `collapsedDevices` and
  `archiveExpanded`, persisted with the rest of the preferences under the signed-in account's key. Device groups
  are open by default, Archives shut. A non-empty search overrides both — it opens every device
  group and every Archive holding a match, without writing either array, and clearing the query
  hands the list back to what was stored. There is no global "show archived" toggle: it only ever
  toggled the hand-archived sessions, which the collapsed Archive already hid, so pressing it
  changed nothing on screen. Archiving a row still works and still calls `session.archive`.
- **The agent filter** is `agentFilter` in the sessions store rather than in a page, so the Sessions
  page and the chat sidebar always show the same slice. It is not persisted, and its options come
  from `selectAgents`, the agents the loaded sessions actually run. A25 turned it from a segmented
  control into a menu beside the device one: an "All" segment plus one per agent was 27 px wider
  than a 400 px viewport, and a menu holds any number of agents at any width. With a filter on, the
  button shows that agent's logo and name.
- **Four agents, each drawn as its own logo** (A25, A26). `agentLabels` in `src/strings.ts` names
  Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build and pi, and an id it does not know is drawn as itself. The mark
  beside or instead of a name is `src/components/AgentLogo.tsx`: one inline `<svg>` per agent with
  the vendor's published vector (Simple Icons for Claude and OpenAI, pi.dev for pi, the Grok mark),
  `fill="currentColor"` and no colour of its own, in a box one em square sitting on the cap height
  of its line, so a logo is the size of the text it stands beside and inherits its ink. An agent
  with no vector falls back to the first letter of its id in the same box, which is what Cursor now
  gets (A26 withdrew it). The component is used in the new-session form's agent control, where the
  logo stands alone because the names do not fit side by side and the line under the row names the
  one that is chosen, in the agent filter's rows and its button, on the session-row chip and in a
  device row's agent list; every segment still carries its agent's name as its accessible name and
  its tooltip. Everything else reads the agent's own lists and draws nothing for an empty one: no
  permission picker in the composer and no permission row in the form for an agent whose
  `permission_modes` is empty, no effort slider and no effort word beside the model for one whose
  `efforts` is empty, so its model card reads the model alone. No shipped agent is empty since A26
  gave pi the three modes its extension enforces, so `tests/agents.test.tsx` holds those branches
  with an agent of its own that lists neither. Agent chips share one quiet tint — the logo and the
  name tell them apart, never a colour per vendor.
- **Popovers and menus** render in a portal on `document.body` and are placed against the viewport,
  flipping to the other side when the one asked for cannot hold the panel and clamping to the
  window's edges. Anchoring them to the trigger instead let a rounded list surface or a scrolling
  pane clip them. The geometry is pure and tested in `src/components/popoverPlacement.ts`; the
  layout effect that applies it, follows an ancestor's scroll and closes on an outside click lives
  in `src/components/Popover.tsx`. Being a portal also makes the panel a sibling of any open modal
  or drawer overlay rather than a descendant, so it takes the top of the layering scale in
  `tokens.css` — `--z-sticky` 20, `--z-overlay` 60, `--z-popover` 100. With the panel below the
  overlay the device picker inside the New session drawer opened behind the drawer and looked dead.
  The drawer's own outside-click check compares the event target with the overlay element, so a
  click inside the portalled panel never closes it.
- **The model card** (A21) is one chip in the composer row reading "<model> <effort>", with a small
  lightning before it while `session.speed` is set. It opens a popover above the composer holding
  two rows. The first has the speed toggle at its leading edge — drawn only when `agent.speeds` is
  non-empty, lit while a tier is on, and cycling standard → each tier → standard through
  `session.set {speed}` where `null` is the standard speed — then the model name, the effort word
  and a chevron; tapping the name replaces the card's contents with the model list rather than
  stacking a second popover on it. The second row is the effort slider, one stop per `agent.efforts`
  entry. Three rules hold the card together:
  - **The word follows the thumb.** The live stop is the card's own state, so the word beside the
    model name changes as the thumb moves rather than when the device echoes the change. The value
    is only sent when the thumb is released: React's `onChange` fires on every step, so the commit
    listens for the DOM's own `change` on the element instead. A change from anywhere else — a
    `/model` in the terminal, another tab — wins over the position the thumb was left in.
  - **Dots and a thick track.** The pill is `.effort-track`, 28 px tall, filled to the thumb in the
    accent colour with one 6 px dot at every stop, and the thumb is a 24 px white disc. The native
    `<input type="range">` is kept for the interaction and the keyboard and drawn transparent on top
    of it, which every engine needs told separately (`::-webkit-slider-runnable-track`,
    `::-moz-range-track` and `::-moz-range-progress`). The fill and the dots live in a layer inset
    by 12 px, half a thumb, because that is the span the thumb's centre travels; `--fill` is the
    percentage across it. The lowest stop draws no fill at all — its rounded cap would be the only
    thing visible, peeking out around the white thumb.
  - **A width that never changes.** `SizedBox` in `src/features/chat/SizedBox.tsx` puts the visible
    label and every `models × efforts` pair (`labelPairs` in `modelLabels.ts`) in one grid cell, the
    alternatives `visibility: hidden` and `aria-hidden`, so the box takes the widest of them. The
    chip and the card's name row both use it, with the ghosts drawn exactly as the visible label is
    — including the lightning whenever the agent lists tiers — so nothing beside them moves while a
    level or a model is chosen. Measured, never guessed: a number would go stale the moment an agent
    renamed a model.
  The slider's accessible name is "Effort" and its `aria-valuetext` is the word, which a screen
  reader announces as "Effort, Extra high"; the toggle names itself "Speed, Fast" or "Speed,
  Standard". An agent with no efforts draws no slider, one with no tiers draws no toggle, and the
  permission-mode picker follows the card in the row. On a session a terminal holds (A17) the same
  chip is drawn as a static value with the tier appended to its label, and it opens nothing.
- **Every change made from the card is drawn at once.** `ChatPage`'s `onSetOption` applies the patch
  to the stored session before `session.set` leaves (`applyOptions` in
  `src/features/chat/sessionOptions.ts`), so the lightning fills, the word changes and the model
  name switches on the click. The reply replaces it; a refusal puts the previous session back and
  shows the error — unless something newer has already replaced what was written, which is a
  `session.updated` that arrived in between or the reply itself. The check compares the store's
  current object identity against the one that was written, not its fields, because the patch and
  the update can carry the same value.
- **Devices offer three actions and one of them is Update** (A22). Every row carries Rename, Update
  and Revoke, in that order, and shows the client version with the first eight characters of
  `client_build` under the status line. `updateNotice` in `src/stores/devices.ts` is the one rule for
  what replaces that build: "Updating…" while `update_state` is `updating`, "Update failed ·
  <message>" for `failed`, and "Update available · <version>" when the device's build differs from
  `config.client.build` — the wheel the gateway serves, read once on boot with the rest of
  `/api/config`. **An update names what it would install**: the page reads the whole `config.client`
  object and hands it to the row as `served`, so the notice carries `client.version` and the
  confirmation says "Update <name> to <version>? Its service restarts; sessions it drives are
  stopped." A gateway too old to name the version of its wheel leaves `client.version` out, and both
  fall back to the bare "Update available" and "…to the gateway's client?". Update confirms first,
  then sends `device.update {device_id, build}` with the gateway's build, never the row's. It is
  disabled with a title saying why while the device is offline, while an update is in flight, when
  the builds already match and when the gateway serves no wheel at all. A refusal the device sends
  back — a running session, a client installed from source — is not an `update_state`, so it is kept
  per device in the store's `updateErrors` and drawn in the same place until the gateway sends that
  device again.
- **Add device asks nothing it does not need.** The modal has no macOS / Linux picker: the installer
  tells the two apart itself with `uname`, so the command is the same on both. The gateway still
  hands out `install.macos` and `install.linux` — the same string today — so a platform whose command
  really differs can be added without a wire change, and `installCommand` in
  `src/features/devices/AddDeviceModal.tsx` is the one place that picks a key.
- **Pairing has two ways in** (A23). The Add device modal mints a code as before and now carries a
  second block, "From your phone", with the one-liner the scan flow uses: the host asks the gateway
  for a claim token and prints it as a QR code encoding `<origin>/pair#<token>`. `/pair` claims that
  token with `POST /api/pairing/requests/{token}/claim` and then shows the handshake the modal
  shows, because the gateway mints the host an ordinary pairing code and `pairing.progress` follows
  it. Claiming spends the token, so `PairPage` claims once per token rather than once per mount — an
  effect that ran twice would answer its own first request with "This code was already used." Signed
  out, the login screen keeps the whole path including the fragment, since the token lives there;
  `rememberedDestination` accepts only a path inside the app.
- **Reconnect** backs off exponentially to 5 s, replies to `ping`, and treats 60 s of silence as a
  half-open socket. Subscriptions are re-issued with the latest `since_seq`.
- **Close codes** 4401 and 4403 end the session and return to login; every other code reconnects.
- **Sending** is always `mode: "auto"`; the device decides between send, steer and queue, and the
  button label follows that decision. "Interrupt & send" is a separate, explicit action.
- **A send shows up immediately** (amendment A12). The app mints the `session.send` request id, and
  the device echoes it as the `user_message` block id, so the composer clears and the bubble is in
  the timeline in the same tick as the click — no waiting for the round trip. It renders dimmed with
  a quiet "Sending…" chip until the device's event replaces it under the ordinary replacement rule,
  so nothing moves and nothing is duplicated. The pending rows live in `timeline.optimistic`, apart
  from the device's blocks: they carry no `seq`, never move the replay cursor, always sort last, and
  survive a resync. `accepted: "queued"` takes the row away again, because the queue row above the
  composer stands for the message until the device dequeues it under that id and it lands as an
  ordinary block; a refusal the gateway is certain about also takes the row away, and hands the
  draft back if nothing was typed since; a minute with no device event turns the chip into
  "Delivery unconfirmed". A device that still mints its own block id is reconciled by `text` and
  `source: "remote"` instead, one row per event.
- **While a question is pending the button reads Answer** (A20). The composer finds the pending
  `question` block with `selectPendingQuestion`, the status line stays "Waiting for your answer",
  and submitting sends `session.answer` rather than `session.send`: the draft becomes the free-text
  answer of the first question with no option selected, beside whatever the card holds for the
  others. Nothing is queued behind a question and no optimistic row is drawn, because an answer is
  not a message. The card's own working state lives in `src/stores/answers.ts`, keyed by
  `request_id`, so the card and the composer submit the same thing; the rules are pure in
  `src/features/chat/answering.ts`. Answer is disabled when the draft has nowhere to go — the first
  unanswered question refuses free text, or every question is already answered on the card, which is
  submitted from the card.
- **Uncertain delivery** is never resent automatically. The composer offers a Retry that reuses the
  original request id.
- **The composer is gated on `control`**, never on `state`.
- **A session's status dot** is toned by `dotTone(state, control, online)` in
  `src/components/dotTone.ts`, never by the state alone: a finished turn on a live session and a
  session whose CLI exited both report `idle`. The five tones and when each applies are the table in
  `docs/DESIGN.md`; `tests/dotTone.test.ts` walks all of it. The looks are five rules in
  `src/components/ui.css`: `working` is a still green, `waiting` an amber that pulses, `live` a
  still amber, `off` grey and `failed` red — green says the agent is working and needs nobody, amber
  says there is something for you, and only `waiting` animates, which the reduced-motion block
  stops. `tests/StatusDot.test.tsx` reads those rules and the class each tone renders. The tooltip
  names the tone, so `live` reads "Done". `OnlineDot`, the device's own dot, is not part of it: it
  is green when the device is online, a grey ring when it is not, and pulses only while the device
  updates itself.
- **`control: "shared"`** (amendments A10 and A11) is a live terminal session the device is
  attached to. It behaves like `remote`: the composer, the queue and approvals all work. What the
  attachment cannot carry is hidden rather than disabled, and "Take over" never appears, because
  there is nothing to take over. Three optional agent booleans say what it carries —
  `shared_interrupt`, `shared_settings` and `shared_attachments` — each defaulting to false.
- **Long output folds** beyond 20 lines, and `output_truncated` adds "Open full output", which
  fetches the untruncated block.
- **Reading position** holds: the timeline auto-follows until you scroll away, then counts new
  blocks behind a "Back to latest" button, centred at the foot of the transcript above the composer
  and widening into a capsule around that centre when it carries a count. One click lands at the
  very end of the transcript and the button leaves.
- **Failed actions** surface in a dismissible banner above the composer rather than failing silently.

## Shared terminal sessions

A session whose `control` is `shared` is driven by a live CLI the device is attached to, so the app
can inject prompts and answer permission prompts without killing the process. A Claude terminal is
attached through the channel shim; a bare `codex` TUI is attached through the shared app-server
daemon, which carries far more.

A control the attachment cannot drive is **hidden, not disabled with a reason**. Nothing above the
composer repeats what the header already says, so an attached session carries no bar of its own: the
status line is left to a running turn's steer or queue notice, "Controlled by the terminal · take
over to send" and "Device offline".

| Surface | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Composer | Enabled, exactly as for `remote`. Send label and queue are unchanged |
| Take over | Never shown. The device is already attached |
| Stop | Shown only when the agent lists the `interrupt` capability **and** the device reports `shared_interrupt`. A Claude channel cannot interrupt, so Stop and "Interrupt & send" both disappear |
| Model / permission mode / effort | Shown when the agent reports `shared_settings`; otherwise not rendered at all, and nothing explains their absence. The title is always editable |
| Attachments | Shown when the agent reports `shared_attachments`; otherwise the button and its file input are not rendered, and pasted files are ignored quietly |
| Attached bar | None. The header's "terminal · attached" is the only place the attachment is named |
| Status label | "terminal · attached" in the sidebar and the Sessions list; the dot tones `shared` exactly like `remote` |
| Approvals | Whatever `options` the block carries. A Claude relay sends Allow and Deny; the Codex daemon sends up to four decisions |
| Questions | Answerable, exactly as for `remote` (A20). The composer's button reads Answer while one is pending, and a question the terminal answered first reads "Answered in the terminal" |

The three booleans are independent and read straight off `AgentInfo`, so no surface needs
agent-specific logic:

| Agent | `attach` | `shared_interrupt` | `shared_settings` | `shared_attachments` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude, through the channel shim | `channel` | false | false | false |
| Codex, through the app-server daemon | `daemon` | true | true | true |

Sending uses the protocol's own modes. On a running shared session `auto` steers when the agent
lists `steer` and is held otherwise, `queue` is always held, and `interrupt` ends the terminal turn
and starts a new one, so "Interrupt & send" needs the same `shared_interrupt` as Stop. The composer
then says "Message will steer the turn…" with a "Send" button when the agent can steer, and
"Message will be queued…" with a "Queue" button when it cannot, matching the status line either
way.

Control changes arrive as a `meta` event carrying `control`, with a `status` event only when the
session state moves as well, so the app never infers the owner from a status change. The transitions
are `terminal → shared` when the attachment registers, `shared → terminal` when it drops, and
`shared → none` when the CLI exits.

### Approvals answered elsewhere

Both sides of a shared session see the same permission request, and whoever answers first wins. When
the terminal answered, the block resolves with the reserved decision `{option_id: "elsewhere", by:
"terminal"}`, which matches none of the offered options on purpose. The card then reads "Answered in
the terminal" rather than falling back to the raw option id. Every other resolved card still names
the option and who decided it.

### Questions answered elsewhere

A question an attached Claude Code session asks exists twice at the same moment: as the CLI's own
dialog in the terminal, and as a card here (A20). Either can answer it and the first one wins. The
card is answerable on a `shared` session exactly as on a driven one, and a question the terminal
answered first resolves with `by: "terminal"`, which the card reads as "Answered in the terminal" —
the same wording an approval answered there uses. A resolved card shows what was answered: the
options that were picked, and the free text that was typed, unless the question was `secret`.

### A held message is a queue entry

A message sent into a shared session while its terminal turn is running is not a block at all
(A19). The device holds it, answers `accepted: "queued"`, and publishes a `queue` event naming it,
so the row from sending moves into "Up next" the way any queued message does. The `user_message`
appears only when the CLI takes it, with a `first_seq` after the output of the turn it waited for —
where the terminal draws it too. One `delivery` state is left on a bubble: "will be re-sent", for a
message the CLI read as mid-turn data. The device replaces the block under its original `block_id`
once the message lands, and the chip disappears.

A `terminal` session whose agent reports `attach` adds one secondary line under "Controlled by the
terminal", saying why this session cannot be driven from here:

| `attach` | `attach_ready` | Hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channel` | `false` | "Start claude through the remote-control shim to control it from here" |
| `daemon` | `false` | "Run rc-client codex setup on the device to attach its Codex sessions" |
| either | `true` | "This terminal session was started without the attachment; restart it to control it from here" |

The "Take over" button beside the hint follows the agent's `takeover` capability, in the composer
bar and in the status line alike, and so do the words. The disabled field says only "Controlled by
the terminal", whatever the agent is; the status line adds " · take over to send" where the button
is, and stops at "Controlled by the terminal" where there is nothing to press. Grok Build and Codex
advertise no `takeover`.

The one line under the hint is worded per `attach` (`src/features/chat/attach.ts`): the shim for
`channel`, `rc-client codex setup` for `daemon`, `rc-client pi setup` for `extension`, and for
`leader` (A28) "Run rc-client grok setup on the device, then restart Grok to attach its sessions";
with `attach_ready` true every kind says the CLI was started without the attachment and must be
restarted. A shared Grok session needs nothing of its own: `shared_interrupt` shows Stop,
`shared_settings` the pickers, and `shared_attachments: false` hides the attachment button.

## Slash commands (A27)

Typing `/` into the composer of a session whose agent carries capability `commands` opens the same
list a terminal opens, above the field. Codex, Grok Build and pi carry it; Claude never does, and on
a Claude session `/` is an ordinary character with nothing to explain it.

**The list.** `src/stores/commands.ts` keeps one entry per `session_id`: the commands, when they
arrived, and whether a request is out. `ChatPage` calls `open()` when the conversation opens and
`refresh()` on the keystroke that opens the panel; `refresh` asks the device again only when the
last answer is older than `COMMANDS_TTL_MS` (60 s), was empty, or never came — the rule
`PROTOCOL.md` §6.3 states. A refusal is stored as an empty list rather than raised: the panel simply
does not appear, the way it does not for an agent without the capability, and the stamp keeps the
next keystroke from asking again at once. Nothing is ever asked for an agent without the capability,
so the gateway never answers `unsupported` on our account.

**Reading the draft** is `src/features/chat/commands.ts`, four pure functions the panel, the send
routing and the tests all share. `commandQuery` is the partial name while the draft is a slash and
nothing else — `/`, `/com`, `/skill:pdf` — and null the moment a space follows, which is what closes
the panel. `matchCommand` reads a complete first word and its argument, and returns null for a name
the session does not offer, so `/nonesuch do the thing` is sent as text exactly as a terminal treats
an unknown slash. `filterCommands` is a prefix of the name in the device's own order, and
`commandSections` groups the rows only when the agent distinguishes more than one group: Codex has
one source and draws no headers, pi draws Built-in, Prompts, Skills and Extensions.

**The panel** is `src/features/chat/CommandMenu.tsx` with its own stylesheet. It is not a popover —
nothing opened it, a keystroke did — so it is drawn in the composer's own flow, anchored to the
field's wrapper and never moving the field down. One row per command: `/name` in the monospace face,
the description after it, the argument placeholder at the trailing edge in the tertiary colour.
Eight rows, then it scrolls. The field keeps focus throughout: the list is a `listbox` the field
points at with `aria-controls` and `aria-activedescendant`, and a mouse press on a row is
`preventDefault`ed so the caret never leaves. ↑/↓ move the highlight and wrap, Tab and Enter take
the highlighted row, Esc puts the panel away until the next keystroke, and a click takes a row.
Taking a row writes `/name ` when the command takes an argument and `/name` when it does not, so the
second Enter runs it — the terminal's own second Enter. Once the first word is complete the panel
gives way to a one-line hint in the same place, naming the command and where its argument goes.

**Sending.** The composer's `submit` asks `matchCommand` first: a listed command becomes
`session.command {name, argument?}` through `useChat.runCommand`, and everything else stays
`session.send`. `runCommand` mints the request id, puts the row in the timeline under it before the
request leaves (A12, exactly as a message does), and marks it accepted when the gateway answers; a
refusal takes the row away again and the message reaches the composer's own error line under the
field, in the device's words. A command is never sent while a turn is running: the rows dim, the
panel grows the footer "Available when the turn finishes", and Send answers with that same sentence
inline rather than spending a round trip on a `conflict` it can predict.

**The output.** What a terminal would have printed comes back as a `tool_call` block whose `tool`
and `title` are the command itself. Two small rules follow: `selectView` in `src/stores/timeline.ts`
draws such a block at Simple as well as Detailed, because it answers what the person asked for
rather than being one of the agent's workings — otherwise `/usage` would run and show nothing — and
`ToolRow` prints the title only when it differs from the tool name, so the row reads `/usage` once.
A `compact` reports as a `notice`; a Grok command may answer nothing at all, and the composer never
waits for output.

**The mock** answers `session.commands` for its Codex, Grok Build and pi sessions from
`commandsFor()` in `mock/fixtures.ts` and nothing for Claude, and `commandScript()` in
`mock/script.ts` plays the echo and a plausible outcome: a `notice` for `/compact`, a `tool_call`
block for Codex's read-only commands, a short turn for the rest, and nothing but the echo for
Grok's `/context`, which renders in its own pager.

## The device row

`features/devices/DeviceRow.tsx` draws what `docs/DESIGN.md` § "The device row" rules. A lucide
`Monitor` outline sits at the leading edge in the secondary ink, the same glyph on every device
whatever its platform, because the app cannot tell a laptop from a desktop and one honest glyph
beats a wrong guess; it is what keeps two devices apart now that no rule is drawn between them, and
`--device-glyph` on `.device-row` is what the lines under the name and the agents on a narrow screen
indent past. The name is the title and nothing repeats it: the hostname and the architecture left
the row for the device's page. The status line carries the online dot, which moved off the name to
sit with the word it belongs to, then "online" or "offline", then the platform as a word from
`platformLabels` in `src/strings.ts` — `macos` → macOS, `linux` → Linux, and a platform that table
does not know printed as the device sent it — and then the session count and the latency or last
seen. The client line and the update notice (A22) are unchanged.

The agents are their logos alone, evenly spaced and with no name and no version beside them; each
logo is wrapped in a `role="img"` span whose `aria-label` and `title` are the agent's name, so the
row still reads aloud and a hover still names the mark. Versions live on the device page's agent
cards. `tests/DevicesPage.test.tsx` holds the row to all of it — one glyph per row, the name once,
no hostname and no architecture, the dot inside `.device-status`, and an agent strip whose text is
empty.

## A device's page (A33)

`/devices/:deviceId` is `features/devices/DevicePage.tsx` with its own `device-page.css`. The row
opens it: `DeviceRow` wraps the device's name in a `Link` whose `::after` is stretched over the
whole row, and the row's menu is lifted above that box, so Rename, Update and Revoke keep working
and none of them navigates. The page repeats none of those three actions.

The header is the online dot, the name, `hostname · platform · arch`, and the client version with
the first eight characters of its build. The hostname and the architecture are here alone — the row
dropped both, and this is where someone goes to check them. Then one card per agent with
`available` true, in the device's own order: the agent's logo, its name and version, and under it
one sign-in line per account. A device with no agents says so in one line.

**The words on an account** are `features/devices/accounts.ts`, pure functions the tests drive
directly. The vendor comes from `vendorLabels` in `src/strings.ts` — `anthropic` → Anthropic,
`openai` → OpenAI, `xai` → xAI — and a provider that table does not know is printed as the device
reported it. Both methods lead with that name: an account reads *Anthropic account · Max · Max 5x ·
me@example.com*, with every part after the first drawn only when the device reported it, and a key
reads *Anthropic API key*, or *OpenAI API key · api.relay.example* when it goes to a third-party
host. pi signs in per provider, so it is the one agent with two of these lines. The plan word is the
vendor's own with its first letter raised, and everything else the device sent — the tier, the
email, the host, the window's scope — is printed exactly as it arrived, in both interface languages,
because it is data and not the app's own words; the device puts its tier into words itself, so
nothing here reformats one. An agent whose
`accounts` is absent came from a device too old to look, and the card says nothing at all; an empty
list is an agent signed in nowhere, and reads *Not signed in*.

**The meters** are drawn for accounts only, because a key has no plan window to measure. A window is
named from `window_minutes` — 300 is *5-hour*, 1440 *24-hour*, 10080 *7-day*, with its scope after
it as *7-day · Fable* — and carries the used share as a fill, the percentage, and *resets 15:40*
today or *resets Tue 22:00* on another day. The fill is the ink colour, the attention colour past
80 % and the danger colour at 100 %; no other colour appears on the page.

**Where the fresh figures live.** `hello` and `agents.updated` carry an account without its windows,
so the devices store never holds one. The page asks `device.agents` when it opens, and
`useDeviceQuota` keeps that reply in the page's own state, under the key of the request that fetched
it — device, reachability, attempt — so a Refresh or another device reads as *Checking…* without the
effect writing that state itself. The stored device is never overwritten, which is what keeps the
list and the new-session drawer from diffing against limits every quarter hour. An offline device is
not asked at all and reads *Offline · quota unavailable* where its meters would be; a
`device_offline` reply says the same; any other refusal, and a per-account `limits_error`, is
repeated in the device's own words with no meter under it.

## Layout and styling

`src/styles/tokens.css` holds every colour, size, radius and shadow, and `src/components/ui.css`
the primitives built on them — `.surface` for a grouped list, `.group-title` for a plain caption
above one, `.group-head` for a caption that doubles as its disclosure control, `.label` for a form
field's label, `.pill`, `.badge`, `.agent-chip`, `.btn` and the status dots. A visual change belongs
in those two files before it belongs in a component. The rules they encode are in `docs/DESIGN.md`:
one canvas, soft surfaces instead of bordered boxes, list rows instead of tables, one hairline
between rows, one filled primary button per surface, tinted rather than outlined chips, and sentence
case everywhere — no `text-transform` in any stylesheet.

**A class name belongs to one feature.** Nothing here is scoped or hashed, so two features that
pick the same name style each other's markup: the accounts screen called its list rows `.user-row`,
which is the chat's own message row, and its hover tint was what appeared under the pointer on a
message bubble. The accounts screen's rows are `.account-row`, `.account-name` and the rest now, and
`tests/css-ownership.test.ts` fails the build when two feature stylesheets take the same root class
again — the first class of a selector, which is what a rule applies to when nothing scopes it. The
message bubble is inert, as `docs/DESIGN.md` rules: neither `.user-row` nor `.user-bubble` has a
hover rule of any kind, because a message is a record and not a control.

At 1024 px and above the chat is two panes with the session sidebar. Below that the sidebar
collapses into the Sessions page, the chat runs full width with a back button, and the composer
sticks above the keyboard. Every page was checked at 400 px.

## Validation

The app was driven in a real Chrome against a real gateway, a real device daemon and the real CLIs:
login, devices, live pairing, the new-session drawer, a streaming Claude turn, an approval card
answered both ways, an `AskUserQuestion` card answered from the UI, Stop, reload from history,
truncated output expanded through `session.block`, a Codex session, a mirrored terminal session,
device-offline and gateway-restart recovery, and the 390 px layout. Details and screenshots are in
`docs/VALIDATION-APPS.md`.

The A11 shared-Codex surfaces were driven in headless Chrome against the mock gateway: the pickers
and the attachment button shown by the two booleans and absent without them, no bar above the
composer on either shared agent, Stop on a shared turn, a send that steers the
running turn, a four-option approval answered with "Always allow commands like this" at 1280 px and
wrapping inside the card at 390 px, the "Answered in the terminal" card, and the daemon hint on a
terminal Codex session. "Interrupt & send" was driven separately and ends the terminal turn before
starting its own. The three send modes and the `bad_request` for an option the block never offered
were checked over the socket against the mock. Screenshots are not checked into the repository.

The approval path was re-verified on the fixed device daemon: the card stays pending until it is
answered, Allow writes the file, Deny leaves it absent, and both decisions are recorded against the
remote user.

The accounts of A24 were driven in the installed Chrome against the mock gateway: the sign-in card
with and without the registration link, the registration card and its three refusals, the Users
screen with its switch, its rows and its dialogs, a member's Settings and its password modal, a
member typing `/users` and landing on Sessions, and two accounts on one browser keeping their own
language and timeline detail. The dated entry is in `docs/VALIDATION-APPS.md`.

The A12 send path was driven in the installed Chrome against the mock gateway: the bubble is on
screen in the frame after the click, the device's echo replaces it in place on the idle, steered and
queued paths, and the queued message is dequeued under its own id with no second bubble. The dated
entry is in `docs/VALIDATION-APPS.md`.

The agents of A25 were driven in the installed Chrome against the mock gateway at 1280 px and
400 px: the marks in the new-session form's agent control, the form dropping a row for a setting
the agent does not list, a terminal-held Grok Build session that reads but does not write, and the
agent filter as a menu naming every agent. The dated entry is in `docs/VALIDATION-APPS.md`.

The slash commands of A27 were driven the same way, at 1280 px and 400 px: the panel on a Codex
session with no group headers, the same panel filtered to two rows with the highlight one row down,
`/usage` run and its `tool_call` block in the transcript at the default Simple level, pi's four
group headers, Grok Build's flat list with its argument hints, the argument hint under a complete
first word, and the dimmed rows and footer on a running turn. Screenshots are not checked into the
repository.

The Grok leader of A28 was driven the same way, at 1280 px and 400 px: the leader hint under a
terminal Grok session whose device has leader mode off, the restart wording once it is on, and the
shared Grok session with its composer live, Stop while running, both pickers and no attachment
button; neither width scrolled sideways.

The logos of A26 were driven the same way, at 1280 px and 400 px: the four logos in the
new-session form's agent control, in the open agent filter and on the session-row chips, and pi's
permission picker in both the form and the composer now that the device's extension enforces its
three modes.

The usage-limit pause of A35 was driven the same way, at 1280 px and 400 px: the Sessions group in
Settings with its switch and its sentence, and the notice above the transcript of the mock's paused
session with the turn's `limit` end and the device's `resume` row under it. Screenshots are not
checked into the repository.

## Not verified

Real Web Push delivery, speech to text (the gateway ran with `STT_PROVIDER=none`, so the mic is
hidden by design), and attachments. Two corners of the approval card are untried: the session-scoped
middle option, and an approval for a command rather than an edit — both cards answered here were
`Write`. `session.delete` and renaming a session exist in the protocol and the device implements
both, but the web UI has no entry point for either.

The round-29 fixes above — per-session drafts, the sign-out fan-out, the timeline cap and the
closed-conversation eviction, the composer's error sentences, the attachment cap, the dictation
that ends with a disabled composer, the STT connect timeout, and the mock's replay bound and send
idempotency — are covered by the vitest suites and were not driven in a browser.
