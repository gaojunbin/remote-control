"""Shared object projections (protocol §3).

One place builds the ``Device`` object so the HTTP list, the app ``hello`` and every
``device.updated`` push agree field for field. The agent inventory is read from the persisted
device record, which the hub refreshes on every hello and ``agents.updated``, so the list renders
the same whether the device is online or asleep.

The same applies to ``User`` (§4.10) and to the ``UserRecord`` the admin lists: one projection for
login, ``GET /api/session``, the app ``hello`` and the account routes.
