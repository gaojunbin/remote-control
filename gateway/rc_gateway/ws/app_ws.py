"""``WS /ws/app`` — the socket the web UI and the iOS app hold open.

The gateway sends ``hello`` immediately so a cold app renders without an extra round trip, then
pushes device and session updates plus the events of every session this connection subscribed to.
Everything on this socket is one account's (A24). A session revoked by ``POST /api/logout``, or by
the admin disabling the account, closes its sockets at once rather than at token expiry.
