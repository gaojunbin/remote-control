"""The preferences an account carries, stored on the gateway rather than in an app (A35, A41).

A preference is a choice that must read the same in the browser, on the phone and on every device
of the account — the browser cannot own it, because the device has to act on it while no app is
running. The file follows ``push_store.py``: its own SQLite database under ``DATA_DIR``, opened at
0600, with additive migrations for anything a later amendment adds.

An account with no row has never touched a preference and reads the defaults, so a fresh gateway
needs no seeding and a deleted account leaves nothing behind. A41 added the Settings screen's own
preferences beside A35's switch; each of them is absent until somebody sets it, so an app can tell
"nobody has chosen" from "chosen, and this is the value", and write its own up the first time.
