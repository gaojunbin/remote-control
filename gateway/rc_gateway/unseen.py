"""Amendment A47: the mark on a session that stopped working and waits for the person (§4.4).

A session works while its state is `running`, a turn under way, and waits for the person while it
asks for an approval or an answer, or rests `idle` or `readonly` with something still holding it:
the status dot's amber. A device moving a session from the first to the second marks it. `starting`
is green too, but a session that only started has done nothing to look at, so it neither brings the
mark nor counts as working again. The transition is read from the states alone, so a turn that
ended while the device was offline marks the session when the device reports it. The session working
again or being archived takes the mark away, and so does an app's `session.seen`, which the hub
applies itself. Nothing else touches it: a session that errored, or whose CLI exited after its
turn, keeps the mark it had and never earns one.

The mark is the gateway's alone. Whatever a device puts in a summary under that name is dropped,
and the stored summaries never hold it: the index keeps it in a column of its own and lays it over
each summary as an app receives it.
