"""Authentication and CSRF checks shared by HTTP routes and WebSocket upgrades.

Two credentials are accepted for the same identity: the HttpOnly cookie a browser gets at login, and
the identical token value in an ``Authorization: Bearer`` header for native apps. The distinction
matters for CSRF: a cookie travels automatically, so a cookie-authenticated mutating request (and
every cookie-authenticated upgrade) must also present an ``Origin`` equal to ``PUBLIC_ORIGIN``. A
bearer token is never attached by the browser on its own and needs no such check.
