"""The routing core: one device slot per device, request forwarding, replay fan-out.

Adapted in structure from cc-remote's ``cc_remote/relay/pairing.py`` (MIT, see
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). What is kept: one connection slot per device with replacement, a send lock
that linearises forwarding against slot changes, and the "drop the whole slow connection" rule.
What is new here: request/reply correlation with gateway-generated ``device_offline`` and
``timeout`` replies, the per-session replay buffer with per-connection cursors, and the session
index.
