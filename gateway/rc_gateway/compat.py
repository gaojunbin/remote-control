"""The oldest build of each separately installed app this gateway still works with (A31, A45).

The web app is served by this gateway and the device client updates itself from the apps, so the
iPhone and Mac apps are the components installed on their own and therefore the only ones that can
be older than the gateway they talk to. Each has its own floor, ``IOS_MINIMUM_APP_VERSION`` and
``MACOS_MINIMUM_APP_VERSION``, and the two move separately: an app reads its own entry of `apps`
and no other, so a change that only older Mac builds cannot follow raises the Mac floor and leaves
the iPhone app's alone.

**Rule for every release, per app: raise an app's constant in the same change that stops the
gateway working with that app's older builds, and leave it alone for an additive change an older
app can ignore.** An app below its minimum shows a blocking "Update required" screen and does
nothing else, so a minimum raised without cause locks working apps out of a gateway that would
have served them.
