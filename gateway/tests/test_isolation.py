"""One device must not reach another device's sessions, and one account not another's.

Every enrolled machine is a separate trust domain: a compromised or buggy client must not be able
to hijack, forge, silence or delete the sessions of another. Accounts (A24) draw the second
boundary, above it: a signed-in socket sees the devices its own account enrolled, the sessions on
them and nothing else, and a request naming anything outside that is answered as if it did not
exist.
