## cc-remote

Parts of this gateway are derived from **cc-remote** (<https://github.com/muggle-stack/cc-remote>),
which is distributed under the MIT License. The derived work has been renamed to this project's
vocabulary (device, app, session, gateway) and reduced to what this protocol needs, but the design
and, in places, the code are the upstream project's.

Files in `rc_gateway/` that contain adapted upstream code, with their origin:

| This file | Upstream file | What was taken |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `connections.py` | `cc_remote/relay/forward.py` | Bounded per-connection send queue with both an item and a byte limit, and the rule that exceeding either drops the whole connection rather than shedding frames |
| `hub.py` | `cc_remote/relay/pairing.py` | One connection slot per device with replacement, the send lock that linearises forwarding against slot changes, and the broadcast / drop-slow-peer structure |
| `auth.py` | `cc_remote/relay/auth.py` | HMAC-signed session token format and constant-time login |
| `session_registry.py` | `cc_remote/relay/server.py` (`SessionRegistry`) | Process-local revocation registry for signed tokens |
| `ratelimit.py` | `cc_remote/relay/server.py` (`LoginRateLimiter`) | Per-IP attempt limiter with global stale-entry cleanup |
| `origins.py` | `cc_remote/relay/origins.py` | Origin canonicalisation used for the CSRF check |
| `devices.py` | `cc_remote/relay/devices.py` | Pairing and enrollment store: hashed codes, hashed tokens, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, single use, device cap |
| `push_store.py` | `cc_remote/relay/push.py`, `cc_remote/relay/native_push.py` | Subscription and delivery-journal schemas, session-scoped rows |
| `push.py` | `cc_remote/relay/push.py`, `cc_remote/relay/native_push_router.py` | Web Push dispatch through pywebpush and the observed-event notification trigger |
| `apns.py` | `cc_remote/relay/native_push.py` | ES256 provider-token cache, the documented APNs failure reasons, and the logging filters that keep device tokens and HPACK header blocks out of the log |
| `logging.py` | `cc_remote/relay/log_safety.py` | Fail-closed credential redaction applied before any handler formats a record |

Deployment files in `deploy/`, `gateway/Dockerfile` and the root `docker-compose.yml` follow the
structure of upstream's `deploy/Caddyfile`, `deploy/Dockerfile` and `deploy/docker-compose.yml`.

## Runtime dependencies

The gateway depends on FastAPI, Starlette, uvicorn, websockets, httpx, pywebpush, py-vapid,
cryptography, python-dotenv and python-multipart. Their licences are recorded in the resolved
dependency set (`gateway/uv.lock`) and in each distribution's own metadata.
